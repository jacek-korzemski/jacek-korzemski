# My most valuable Frontend app

Is this one [MetalMusicApp](https://github.com/jacek-korzemski/react-music-app-2) - This is music app, with huge base of metal albus gatheres through my side [Laravel Project](https://github.com/jacek-korzemski/youtube-music-app-back). Right now, on [production](http://react.metalmusic.pl/) there is old version of an app.

## App Structure

The main part, most important for me is the Frontend built with React.

Backend is split into two different roles:

1. [Music database](https://github.com/jacek-korzemski/youtube-music-app-back) - build with Laravel API, with simple CLI for CRON automation, that gather new records every hour.
2. [NodeJS / Express](https://github.com/jacek-korzemski/MetalMusicPortfolio_backend) app working with MongoDB, that will handle all user-oriented actions, like rating videos or writing reviews.

## Why two backends?

Becouse I would love to host this app for free as long as possible. Right now - hosting simple PHP API for huge database with CRON automation separetly, will allow me to use free tier for less popular actions.
