- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jacek-korzemski
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in coding, playing games and making music

# My most valuable app

Is this one: https://github.com/jacek-korzemski/youtube-music-app-front (frontend) and this one: https://github.com/jacek-korzemski/youtube-music-app-back (backend) (production: http://react.metalmusic.pl/)

## UPDATE

Right now, I'm reworking the whole front app, you can see WIP here: https://github.com/jacek-korzemski/react-music-app-2
First of all, I want to make it with TypeScript and use my skills that I've learned since last year.

## About the app

This is a music app, based on my favorite channels from youtube. It contains: 
- Backend built with Laravel, 
- some simple PHP CLI interface for updating MySQL database with new records from youtube (in production, database is updated every hour),
- Frontend built in React.
The app is stil in developement.
